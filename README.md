# Wumpus-World-Android
This is a wumpus world game that is solved using the A* algorithm for cs 370
This app was made 

This app was made for a class project,

A-Star algorithm
The A-Star algorithm is a search algorithm that is both complete and optimal. 
That means that the search will always be completed and the best possbile search will be returned. 
The algorithm solves the problem by calculating the g(n) + h(n) 

The professor gave me a "B" for the projectâ€¦

What grade do you think I should have gotten on this project? 
Let me know, leave me a review, hopefully we can hit 5k users by June
